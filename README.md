# Hammer of Power

Adds a steel hammer and the powerful version that you can create from it.

### Supports Minetest Game and [Nodecore](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Warr1024/nodecore/)

#

## Usage

Rightclick to spawn a fling entity in your pointed direction

Punch the fling entity to fling yourself in that direction
You will take fall damage if your hammer can spawn a fling entity again (It can do so 5 seconds after punching a fling entity, your wielditem will indicate when the time is up because it will stop moving upwards)
To prevent yourself from taking fall damage you need to rightclick the ground you are falling on before you land on it. This can be achieved by holding down rightmouse and aiming at the ground.
If you do land with the rightmouse method all entities including players within a 3 node radius will be blasted away from you, the greater the falling velocity the farther they will fly. So flinging yourself downwards in midair results in a bigger blast.

Rightclick the fling entity to throw your hammer, the hammer will return to you after a while, but if it hits a player it will grab that player and allow you to move them around.
Hold down RMB and once the hammer detects that it will throw the player in your look direction and return to you
